### Cell Sandbox

Cell Sandbox is a cyberbiology software toy that allows you to create various ecosystems using living cells.
Each cell has its genome that encodes its type, behavior and other things.
Cells can do different things depending on their type.
Also, they can stick to each other to form a multicellular organism.
Given an ecosystem with living cells, you can add some radiation to make cells' genome get random changes when the cell splits. On a large time interval, this may allow you to see the evolution process emerging from, at first glance, simple world rules.

This project is created for Devexperts OpenHack 2022 event ❤️.
